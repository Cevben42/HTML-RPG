RPG Quest is a lightweight, browser-based role-playing game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
In this project, players can create a character, explore a fantasy world, engage in turn-based battles with monsters, manage an inventory, and level up â€” all through their web browser. 
The primary goal of this project is to offer a minimal, expandable RPG framework that anyone can fork, study, and customize to build their own adventures.
